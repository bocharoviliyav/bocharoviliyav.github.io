Hi all! My name is Ilia Bocharov.


I'm a full-stack developer.
My main programming language is Java. I've been writing code on Java since 2015.
In 2018, I started to write on Typescript, and I'm very excited about it.
I'm currently learning to Go and improving my Java skills.
Since 2018 I work with containerized applications.
I've used Java 8/11, Angular 7/8, React, Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes, Rancher,
Gitlab CI, Bamboo, Jenkins, Oracle, Postgres, Mysql.
I've experience with Grafana, Prometheus, ELK stack, Nexus, Nginx.
I will share part of my knowledge here.
