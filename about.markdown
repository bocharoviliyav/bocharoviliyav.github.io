Hi all! My name is Ilia Bocharov.


I'm a full-stack developer.
My main programming language is Java. I've been writing code on Java since 2015.
In 2018, I started to write on Typescript, and I'm very excited about it.
I'm currently learning Rust and improving my Java skills.
I've about three years of work with containerized applications.
At the start, I've to use OpenShift + Jenkins + Docker + Java 8/11 or Angular 7/8.
Now I work with Kubernetes + Gitlab + Docker + Java 8.
I've experienced with Grafana, Prometheus, ELK stack, Jenkins, Nexus, Nginx.
I will share part of my knowledge here.
