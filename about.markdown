Hi all! My name is Ilia Bocharov.


I'm a fullstack developer. 
My main programming language is Java, I've been writing code on Java since 2015. 
In 2018, I started to write on Typescript, and I'm very excited with it.
I'm currently learning Rust and improving my Java skills.
I want to share part of my experience here.
